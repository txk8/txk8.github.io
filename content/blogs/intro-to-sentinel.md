I recently completed a course with Microsoft covering how to configure Sentinel from scratch, one step at a time. I've recoreded these steps here in one place to help remember and also to create a guide. 

### Ordered List

1. Deploy a Sentinel workspace
2. Install Content Hub solutions and ingest Windows Security logs
3. Configure DCRs, an NRT rule, and automation; validate the setup
4. Run a simulated attack to test analytics and automated response
