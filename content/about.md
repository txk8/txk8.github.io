My name is Kate Fowler and I'm an Azure Engineer with a background in Cyber Security. I currently work in cloud engineering, with several years of experience across security, vulnerability management, and cloud platforms. Over time, I've moved from more security-focused roles into hands-on cloud engineering, where I get to combine security, infrastructure, and automation rather than treating them as separate concerns.

Outside of work, I like staying active through sports, especially weightlifting🏋‍♀. More recent experiements include surfing and pickleball. I'm a bit obsessed with travel and would love to work & live abroad in the future 🌴. I also enjoy learning new languages 🇪🇸. 

This site is a small space where I share what I'm working and learning on. If you'd like to connect, you can find me by clicking on the LinkedIn button above.
